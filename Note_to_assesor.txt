I added ESLinter and a per-commit hook. The hook doesn't get pushed with the code so no way to show it. 
The script for the hook was from:

So credit goes to @Rashty for that.


#Hello,

# For background info, when I applied for this position, it was based on the keywords Python 
# and Selenium Webdriver. My knowledge of JS is basic and comes from an online tutorial and
# I have never seen Cucumber code before (even though it was on my list of things to learn). 
# Therefore, when I saw that the task was all in JS/Cucumber I was hesitant to do it as I 
# thought that I would be out of my depth. However, the challenge was too intriguing so I 
# spent a day or so learning JS and Cucumber, then I gave the task a try. This meant that I 
# was left with just under 1 day to do the task.

# I didn't have a chance to read about JS/Cucumber conventions or best practices. If you 
# find any beginners' mistakes, you know why :)

# Having said that, I enjoyed doing the assesment and whatever the outcome of your review I
# would greatly appreciate your feedback as it is an area that I am interested in learning.

# Kind regards,

# Ammar Al-Taweel


# Assumptions:
# - Links leading outside the site are not tested.
# - There is an external tool that tracks the requirements and links each requirement to the 
# test(s) that verify it.
# - The requirement for "Clicking on a sector shows a list of jobs from only that sector." 
# was not very clear. Individual jobs didn't have sector indicators attached to them. I am 
# assuming that the page title is sufficient to show that we are showing the right jobs for 
# the sector.
